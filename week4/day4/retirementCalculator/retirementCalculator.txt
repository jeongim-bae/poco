Inputs: my current age, and my expected retirement age
Outputs: how many years left until retirement, and the year I retire
Process: 1. calculate the duration until retirement ( my expected retirement age - my current age)
         2. calucate the year of retirement ( current year + the duration until retirement)

Constraints:
1. The crreunt age and the retirement age should be integer and between 1 and 150.
2. The retirement age should be older and eaqual to current age.

Edge cases:
1. The each input is empty.
2. The each input is beyond the range. e.g. 0 or 151
3. The  each input is not an integer. e.g. 30.5 or thirty
4. The current age is higher than the retirement age. e.g. current age is 30, and retirement age is 25.
5. Muiliple times of wrong value for an input.

Test cases:
1. The each input is integer within range. (current age: 30, retirement age: 50)
2. The two inputs are same ages. (current age: 30, retirement age: 30))
3. The boundary cases. (current age: 1, retirement age: 150)
